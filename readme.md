# Chronus
This Discord bot was created by Nile Wilson on May 4, 2018. This bot is simple and can be used to print the current local time of a user in a server. This bot currently does not account for daylight savings. If you want to update your registered timezone, simpley use the `!setzone` command.

## Invite the bot
The bot is currently private, but once it is set to public, you may invite Chronus to your server [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=441726905301991425&scope=bot](here).

## Commands
For command help, please type `!help @Chronus` in your server.

## Future work
Planning on adding a few more simple functions, including `!gettime @here` and `!gotosleep`
